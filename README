Project has gone into cryo-sleep for the time being...

Project: ComicRate
Languages: Java, JavaScript, CSS, JSP

This project started as a nifty way to track how people liked the DC new 52. It has since grown into a way to track all comic likes.

Alpha was deployed here (with nginx tunneled to Tomcat): http://darrgotek.com/ComicRate
